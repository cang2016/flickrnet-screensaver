Flickr.Net ScreenSaver is written by Sam Judson (sam@wackylabs.net)

It is a basic screensaver which can pull photographs from the Flickr photo sharing web site. http://www.flickr.com

Once you have installed it go into the configuration and choose the user or group you want to use and then wait! (or click the preview button).

Enjoy!
